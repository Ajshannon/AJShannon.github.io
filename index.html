    <h3 align="center">Where I come from</h3>
    <p align="center">If you were to ask me where I am from, I would probably tell you I am originally from San Bernardino.</p> 
    <p align="center">Which in fact; is true. I was born on a navy base there and promply moved to indiana. </p>
    <p align="center">I do find myself at times reluctant to say I am a hoosier. </p>
    <h3 align="center">Why I'm Here</h3>
    <p align="center">I would say I am trying to become a better man. At least the kind I would think would make a good dad and husband</p>
    <p align="center"> Which for me means being able to provide financially and having a stable job.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Where I am going</h3>
    <p align="center"> I believe that learning how to code will ultimately create a strong foundation.
    <p align="center"> One where I can kickstart my career off of.</p>
